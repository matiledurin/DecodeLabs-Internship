## Business Problem

Can a machine read emotion?

This project teaches a model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative — using 50,000 real IMDB reviews, text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorisation, and Naive Bayes classification.

> **Business question: Given a piece of text written by a customer, can we automatically determine whether their sentiment is positive or negative — without a human reading it?**

**Why this matters in the real world:**
- Netflix and streaming platforms use sentiment to understand which content audiences love
- Amazon flags negative product experiences before they go viral
- Banks detect fraud risk from the language in customer complaints
- Brands monitor social media sentiment at scale — thousands of posts per minute
- Customer support systems automatically triage complaints by emotional urgency

## Dataset

| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Source | IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset (Kaggle) |
| Total records | 50,000 reviews |
| Class balance | 25,000 positive / 25,000 negative — perfectly balanced |
| Target variable | `sentiment` (positive / negative) |
| Training set | 40,000 reviews (80%) |
| Test set | 10,000 reviews (20%) |

This is an industry-standard benchmark dataset used by NLP researchers worldwide.

## Analytical Pipeline

| Step | Task | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | Data Loading & Exploration | ✅ Complete |
| 2 | Text Preprocessing | ✅ Complete |
| 3 | TF-IDF Vectorisation | ✅ Complete |
| 4 | Model Training | ✅ Complete |
| 5 | Evaluation & Comparison | ✅ Complete |

## Key Results

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Overall Accuracy | 87% |
| Precision | 87% |
| Recall | 87% |
| F1-Score | 87% |
| Test set size | 10,000 unseen reviews |

**Confusion matrix (approximate):**

| | Predicted Negative | Predicted Positive |
|--|--|--|
| **Actual Negative** | 4,300 ✅ True Negative | 700 ❌ False Positive |
| **Actual Positive** | 600 ❌ False Negative | 4,400 ✅ True Positive |

The model is well-balanced — it does not systematically favour one class over the other.

## Text Preprocessing Pipeline

Every decision in preprocessing was deliberate:

### 1. HTML tag removal
```python
re.sub(r'<.*?>', '', text)
```
IMDB reviews contain HTML formatting from the web scraping process. This removes it before any text analysis.

### 2. Lowercasing & punctuation removal
Ensures "Brilliant" and "brilliant" are treated as the same word.

### 3. Stopword removal — with a critical exception
Common words like "the", "and", "is" are removed. However, **negation words are deliberately kept:**
```python
# These words are EXCLUDED from the stopword removal list
negation_words = {'not', 'never', 'nor', 'no', 'none', 'neither', 'hardly', 'barely'}
```
**Why this matters:** "not good" is the opposite of "good". A model that removes "not" cannot distinguish between these two meanings. Keeping negation words is a precision engineering decision that directly improves accuracy.

### 4. Lemmatisation (not stemming)
```python
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
# "running", "ran", "runs" → all become "run"
```
Lemmatisation uses grammatical rules to find the true root form of a word. Stemming is faster but cruder — it often produces non-words ("running" → "runn"). Lemmatisation is the more accurate choice.

## TF-IDF Vectorisation

```python
TfidfVectorizer(
    max_features=50000,
    ngram_range=(1, 2),   # unigrams + bigrams
    stop_words=None        # handled in preprocessing
)
```

**What TF-IDF does:** Measures how important a word is in one review relative to the entire dataset.
- Words that appear everywhere ("film", "movie") get **downweighted** — they carry no sentiment signal
- Rare, specific words ("breathtaking", "abysmal") get **upweighted** — they carry strong sentiment signal
- Bigrams (word pairs like "not good", "absolutely brilliant") capture context that single words miss

**Result:** Each review is transformed into a vector of 50,000 numbers — a mathematical representation of its language.

## Models Compared

| Model | Description | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| `MultinomialNB` | Standard Naive Bayes for text | Primary model |
| `ComplementNB` | Variant designed for text classification | Comparison model |

**Why Naive Bayes?**

Naive Bayes assumes all words are independent — which is not strictly true in language. Yet it achieves ~87% accuracy on 50,000 real reviews. This demonstrates a core data science principle: **a simpler model with good preprocessing often outperforms a complex model with poor data preparation.**

## How to Run

1. Download all files from this folder to your computer
2. Open `PROJECT_4_DECODELABS_MATILE_.ipynb` in **Jupyter Notebook**, **JupyterLab**, or **Google Colab**
3. Run the NLTK downloads cell first (required on first run):
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
```
4. Run all cells in order — the notebook loads `IMDB_Dataset.csv` from the same folder automatically

**Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

> **Want to see the project without running any code?** Open `project4_presentation.html` in any web browser — Chrome, Firefox, or Edge. It includes an interactive demo where you can type any text and see the sentiment model respond in real time.

## Real-World Applications of This Pipeline

| Industry | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| Retail & E-commerce | Automatic product review classification at scale |
| Finance | Customer complaint sentiment for risk triage |
| Healthcare | Patient feedback analysis for service improvement |
| Marketing | Brand sentiment monitoring across social media |
| HR | Employee survey sentiment for attrition signals |
| Media | Content recommendation driven by audience reaction signals |

## Limitations

- Naive Bayes treats all words as independent — it cannot model complex syntactic relationships
- Sarcasm and irony remain difficult for any bag-of-words model to detect
- The model is trained on English movie reviews — performance may degrade on other domains or languages
- State-of-the-art models (BERT, RoBERTa) achieve ~95% on this benchmark vs ~87% for this approach — the gap represents the cost of simplicity and the benefit of deeper architectures
